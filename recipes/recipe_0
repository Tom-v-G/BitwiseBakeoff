In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, and salt. Set aside.

In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and milk until well combined. Add the vanilla extract and mix until smooth.

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips and baking soda.

Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches (5 cm) of space between each cookie.

Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
