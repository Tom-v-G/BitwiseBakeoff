* 45.14 grams sugar
* 62.86 grams flour
* 29.14 grams egg
* 0.57 grams salt
* 8.57 grams chocolate chips
* 0.57 grams baking soda

**Recipe:**

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.

Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie.

Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your delicious Chocolaty Cookies!
