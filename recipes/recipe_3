**Non-Fat Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe**

**Ingredients:**

* 15.38 grams sugar
* 66.27 grams flour
* 1.78 grams egg
* 0.59 grams salt
* 88.76 grams chocolate chips
* 0.59 grams baking soda
* 88.17 grams butter
* 1.18 grams milk
* 37.28 grams vanilla extract

**Recipe:**

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients until just combined, being careful not to overmix. Stir in the chocolate chips.

Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space between each cookie. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your delicious non-fat chocolate chip cookies!
